The game has been divided into two seasons, each consisting of nine episodes. The first season was released in 2018 and received mixed reviews from critics and players. The second season was delayed due to development issues and was finally launched in 2023.
 
The first episode of the second season, titled No Sanctuary, introduces a new map, a new enemy faction, and a new gameplay mode. The patch also fixes some bugs and improves the performance and stability of the game.
 
## What's New in No Sanctuary?
 
No Sanctuary takes place in an abandoned church that has been turned into a stronghold by a group of fanatical cultists. The cultists worship the walkers and believe that they are the chosen ones who will inherit the earth. They are armed with melee weapons and explosives and will stop at nothing to protect their sanctuary.
 
The survivors have to infiltrate the church and find a way to destroy it from within. They can either go stealthy or loud, depending on their preference and strategy. The map features multiple paths, hidden rooms, traps, and environmental hazards that can be used to their advantage or disadvantage.
 
The episode also introduces a new gameplay mode called Siege. In this mode, the survivors have to defend a location from waves of enemies for a certain amount of time. They can use barricades, turrets, mines, and other items to fortify their position. The mode can be played solo or with up to three other players online.
 
## Is It Worth Playing?
 
No Sanctuary is a welcome addition to OVERKILL's The Walking Dead. It adds some variety and challenge to the game and offers a different perspective on the zombie apocalypse. The map is well-designed and atmospheric, and the cultists are a formidable and creepy enemy. The Siege mode is also fun and engaging, especially with friends.
 
However, the episode is not without its flaws. The patch does not address some of the core issues that plague the game, such as the lack of content, the repetitive gameplay, the poor AI, and the technical glitches. The episode is also quite short and can be completed in less than an hour.
 
Overall, No Sanctuary is a decent patch that improves the game slightly but does not fix its major problems. It may appeal to fans of the series who want to see more of the game's story and lore, but it may not be enough to attract new or returning players who are looking for a more polished and satisfying experience.
